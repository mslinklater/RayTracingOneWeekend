*Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This project is my take on the first of Peter Shirley's 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' books. This code was originally copied out of his book but then I've added some bits and changed some stuff around to suit my preferences.

You can take thr raw C++ and build a makefile if you like or you can do what I did and just open the first.pro file up in QtCreator. Although I use QtCreator this is still a command line program. I just like using the Qt tools for quick knocky-up stuff.

I wrote this code on Linux (I use Kubuntu 18.04), but it should compile fine on Windows and OSX but I haven't tested it at all on those platforms.
