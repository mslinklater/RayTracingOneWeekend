# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This depot contains various projects spawned from reading Peter Shirleys 'Ray Tracing in One Weekend' books. The 'first', 'second' and 'third' folders contain code relevant to that particular book. I'm planning on going back through the books and implementing the ray tracer in Rust next, mainly as a learning exercise... you'll find those Rust projects in here too.

Thanks for looking
